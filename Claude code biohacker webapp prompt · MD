# Claude Code Prompt: Biohacker Webapp Presentation for Management

## Context

You are building an interactive webapp presentation for Prime Reaction's management team. This presents the VUCA Prime Strategic Framework for our VO2-Reaction System—a breakthrough fitness technology platform that achieves "metabolic-cardiac dissociation" (burning jogging-level calories at walking-level heart rates).

**Target Audience:** Executive leadership, board members, potential investors
**Tone:** Premium biohacker aesthetic—think Oura Ring meets institutional investor deck
**Purpose:** Strategic alignment tool that makes complex physiological science and IP strategy visually compelling

## Content Structure

### Section 1: Opening Impact (Hero)

**Headline:** "The 3:1 Leverage Ratio"
**Subhead:** "What if you could burn jogging calories at walking heart rates?"

**Key Visual:** Animated comparison showing:
- Left side: Traditional exercise (VO₂ +27% = HR +27%)
- Right side: Prime Reaction (VO₂ +27% = HR +9%)

**Data Callout (animated counter):**
```
VO₂ Increase: +26.9%
HR Increase: +8.5%
Leverage Ratio: 3:1
p-value: <0.001
Sample Size: N=19
```

---

### Section 2: The Problem We Solve

**Section Title:** "75 Years of Assumptions. One Breakthrough."

**Three problem cards (hover to expand):**

1. **27 Million Americans** on beta-blockers cannot achieve training heart rates
2. **$50-80 Billion** annual cost of fall prevention with no dominant solution  
3. **$5 Billion** cardiac rehab market using 50-year-old modalities

**Visual:** Timeline showing exercise physiology stagnation (1950s → 2025) with Prime Reaction breaking the pattern

---

### Section 3: VUCA Framework Overview

**Interactive diagram:** Four quadrants that expand on click/hover

| Challenge | Response | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Volatility** → Vision | Category definition |
| **Uncertainty** → Understanding | Bounded unknowns |
| **Complexity** → Clarity | Three-pillar strategy |
| **Ambiguity** → Agility | Multi-frame positioning |

**Animation:** VUCA transforms into PRIME with connecting arrows

---

### Section 4: The Science (Simplified)

**Section Title:** "Metabolic Arbitrage"

**Interactive Infographic:** Human body silhouette showing:
- Cardiovascular system (heart rate) → minimal increase
- Neuromuscular system (stabilizers) → high activation
- Metabolic output (calories/oxygen) → significant increase

**Key Insight Card:**
> "Stochastic perturbation creates metabolic demand through neuromuscular recruitment rather than cardiovascular escalation."

**Pilot Data Visualization:**
- Walking (Control): VO₂ baseline, HR baseline
- Walking + Perturbation: VO₂ +26.9%, HR +8.5%
- Walking + PBFR: VO₂ +73% (additional study)

---

### Section 5: IP Portfolio Visualization

## Deliverable

A single-page webapp (or multi-route app) that:
1. Tells the Prime Reaction strategic story visually
2. Impresses biohacker/longevity-focused executives
3. Can be used in board meetings and investor presentations
4. Exports key sections as shareable assets (optional)

**Primary success metric:** A management viewer should understand the 3:1 leverage ratio, IP value, and strategic roadmap within 5 minutes of interactive browsing.

## Reference Aesthetic

Think: 
- Oura Ring's dark, premium dashboard
- Eight Sleep's health data visualizations  
- Levels (CGM) investor materials
- Apple Fitness+ interface elements
- Stripe's Atlas documentation design
